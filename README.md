roxanne-font
============

### A Good and Normal bitmap font family

### Features:

* ASCII *and* ISO-8859-1 characters!
* Il1i and O0o are distinguishable, but not with the ridiculous flourishes that mar some programming fonts.

### Available weights:

* 12x5 semicondensed, no bold, no oblique; monospaced and proportional

### But don't take my word for it:

A C file from the lovely [t2d](http://github.com/smschm/t2d) is modeling for us.

*Monospace:*

*Proportional:* (getting pretty cramped, especially with fake bold)
